**Connect 4**

**GOAL**

It is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid.
The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column.
The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one’s own discs. Connect Four is a solved game.


**DESCRIPTION**

Before you can start playing Connect Four or planning a strategy, you must make sure that you understand the object of the game. In order to win, a player must get four checkers in their color in a row. Whoever does it first is the winner.
There are three ways to get four checkers in a row in Connect Four: horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
When it’s your turn to make a move in Connect Four, you take a checker and drop it down one of the slots at the top of the grid. Like standard boards, this game too has seven columns and six rows to choose from. On your first move, you will typically wind up placing your checker in the bottom row, but you can choose any of the columns, depending on your strategy.
You want to choose each move carefully because your opponent will have a turn after you. Not only do they have a chance to thwart your strategy for four in row, your move can sometimes make it easier for them to get four of their checkers in a row.
After you make a move with your checker, your opponent gets a chance to go. As you plan each of your moves, try to imagine how your opponent will respond. That allows you to react to their moves quickly and decisively. Before you drop a checker into the grid, ask yourself what you would do next if your opponent had made the move that you’re about to.
